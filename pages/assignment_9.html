 				<p>I'm very excited about a new indie game called No Man's Sky. It features you, the space traveler, and all other online players with the primary objective of reaching the center of the game's univerese. Though the game has a primary objective, it may not seem realistic to some as the creator estimates 98% of the planets in the game will never be visited; to give you some perspective on how big the game actually is. Each planet is home to unique creatues, alien lore, and materials which are used to further your character build better interstellar gear and communications with the universe's vast array of intelligent species.</p>
 				<p>No Man's Sky's release date is a mockery of the famous "Free Crabs Tomorrow" painting plastered on the side of every Joe's Crab Shack. It has been delayed time after time, but in order to convey how hard the game's team is working the creator has stepped up to consistently demo expected, ever-extending features. You can read more about this exciting new game by clicking on the Atlas (the diamond) pictured to above.</p>
